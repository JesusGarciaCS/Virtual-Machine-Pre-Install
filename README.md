# Vitrual Machine Pre-Install

We want a virtual machine on our host machine, so our host machine would not get corrupt. Our host machine is our main machine that we will be running, but we do not want to check malware on it, so a virtual machine would be a perfect planform to contain any malicious scripts. In order to do this, we first must enter the BIOS to Enable Virtualization.

1. Turn ON the System.
2. Press F2 key at startup BIOS Setup.
3. Press the right arrow key to Advanced tab, Select Virtualization and then press the Enter key.
4. Select Enabled and press the Enter key.
5. Press the F10 key and select Yes and press the Enter key to save changes and Reboot into Windows.
